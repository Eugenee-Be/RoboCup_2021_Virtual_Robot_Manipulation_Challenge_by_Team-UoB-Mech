# RoboCup_2021_Virtual_Robot_Manipulation_Challenge_by_Team-UoB-Mech
This project used template and virtual machine environment provided by competition committee of RoboCup.  
  
The objective is to drive robot arm pick and place the objects on the table to the selected location -- bins.  
  
There were many attempts to learn and utilise functions that might be useful from the examples in Robotics Toolbox documentation.  
  
Unfortunately, the code fails to run to activate the robot arm doing the expecting work.
