# Overview  
  
This project used template and virtual machine environment provided by competition committee of RoboCup.  
  
The objective is to drive robot arm pick and place the objects on the table to the selected location -- bins.  
  
There were many attempts to learn and utilise functions that might be useful from the examples in Robotics Toolbox documentation.  
  
Unfortunately, the code fails to run to activate the robot arm doing the expecting work.  
  
Hopefully, we can learn the methods of manipulating the robot arm from the compeleted work later on so as to apply in the future study and competition experience. That's also the initial intention of joining the challenge. We wish this will be a good start of robotics learning journey and a essential part of applying for master's degree study.  
  
It'll be great if we can get feedback and example solution to improve ourselves when the competition is finished.

# Thoughts  
  
1. _More detailed learning materials and competition closely related materials and workshops needed._  
As non-computer science (Mech Eng) UG students and beginners of robotics control, we felt extremely no clue to construct our work.   
We read through every related examples in the documentation and it's easy to understand them. However when it comes to write the codes we felt blank in our mind.  
  
2. _Appreciation_  
Thanks for the great support to us from April and Jose. They answered our questions and enquiries very quickly and patiently.
